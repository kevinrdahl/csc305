## ImageKit
This project implements a simple matlab-like syntax for generating/showing/saving images.
The image is shown on screen using GLFW and openGL. The image is saved to disk using libpng and zlib.
Please see main.cpp for the usage demo.

This framework has been tested on the following platforms :

- OSX Yosemite 10.10.5 + XCode 7.0.1 Build &A1001
- Windows 10.1 + Visual Studio 2013 Community (VS12)

To run this framework on any other platforms, the required libraries need to be recompiled according to the target OS.
